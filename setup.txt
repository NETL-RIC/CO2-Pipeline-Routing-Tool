To run the react web app:

1. Make sure node.js and npm (node package manager) are installed on your computer. To determine if node.js and npm are installed,
 run node -v and npm -v on the command line. If it is properly installed, you should see text that tells you which version
 it is. An error or warning will show if it is not installed.

    1A. If node.js and npm are not installed on your computer, contact IT to install it for you as it requires admin priviliges. 
    Select the Windows installer at https://nodejs.org/en/download. npm comes packaged with node.js, so if node.js is installed,
    npm will be installed also. Now retry step 1 to determine if both are installed.

2. Before running the project, certain library dependencies must be installed for the project to function. These are:
    2A. leaflet
    2B. react-leaflet
    2C. react-widgets
    2D. react-bootstrap
    2E. axios
    To install these libraries, open the terminal and enter npm install leaflet, npm install react-leaflet, npm install react-widgets,
    npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap, and npm install axios respectively.

3. Now that node.js, npm, and the required packages are installed, the react app can be run. Navigate to the web folder location and enter 
npm start in the terminal. You should see text saying that the project is starting, as well as text saying the project has compiled
successsfuly with a link to view the web app if it does not pop up automatically. 

Note: Since this project has already been created, there is no need to create a new react app from scratch. However if one were to do this
for a new project, enter npx create-react-app nameofapp --use-npm to generate a new react project from scratch.
