    abstract = {Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an important technology to mitigate climate change and the proper design of CCS infrastructure is essential for large-scale CCS deployments. However, constructing new CCS transport infrastructure is expensive, requiring substantial investments and extensive negotiations with various landowners. Given that many pipeline infrastructures, such as pipelines and pipeline rights-of-way (ROWs), are available, it is anticipated that converting these existing infrastructures for transportation would be beneficial for CCS deployments. Therefore, this work is focused on reusing existing infrastructures to reduce the overall costs and accelerating CCS deployments. To reuse existing CO2 pipelines and ROWs, we first obtained and analyzed various data on CO2 pipelines and ROWs. Next, we integrated the existing pipeline route data into a generated candidate pipeline network for optimization. For the existing pipeline ROWs, we generated an updated cost weight surface map based on various Geographic Information System (GIS) information, which was then utilized to the subsequent pipeline network optimization. We tested the newly developed computational capabilities on CO2 pipeline infrastructure design projects in the Intermountain West (I-West) region of the United States, where multiple existing CO2 pipelines and ROWs of pipelines (e.g., natural gas and crude oil pipelines) are available. The results show that the reutilization of existing infrastructure impacts the optimal CCS pipeline network, including pipeline routes and overall transport costs. Specifically, if the existing CO2 pipelines meet the transport requirements, they can potentially be used without constructing new ones. On the other hand, if the existing CO2 pipeline is not available, new pipelines can potentially be built utilizing existing pipeline ROWs to reduce the costs associated with obtaining new ROWs. Given that there are over thousands of miles of existing CO2 pipelines and millions of miles of natural gas pipelines in the United States, the new modeling capabilities developed in this work will play a key role in accelerating large-scale CCS deployment.},

    ABSTRACT={The deployment of carbon management strategies like carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon dioxide removal (CDR) at scale will require significant investments in transport infrastructure to deliver CO2 to reliable storage. While pipeline transport has dominated the conversation due to economic reasons, there is increasing evidence that other modes may become viable alternatives when considering scale, regional opportunities, and social acceptance. This paper assesses the viability of rail for CO2 transport in the United States. We believe rail presents many advantages, notably in existing infrastructure with established right-of-ways, but also as an instrument to address unwanted effects of our energy transition, particularly in coal communities. We find that the strategic replacement of coal as a freight commodity could translate into 100 Mt/yr of CO2 movement by rail by 2050, and support up to 60,000 jobs in that industry. Further, we find that while rail pricing is notoriously volatile, there is strong support for rail being the least cost option over pipeline for volumes under 2 Mt CO2 per year, which aligns well with smaller, more risk-averse, and distributed carbon management projects that are scheduled to deploy over the next decade. Rail can also be an alternative in regions where CO2 pipeline projects have had limited success, like in the Midwest, where CO2 is captured from ethanol plants that are already serviced by rail networks. Likewise, rail can service roughly 25 percent of point-source CCS opportunities that are not proximal to projected trunk pipeline networks, of which 94 percent are located 1-mile from railroad. Finally, rail may be an integral part of CDR development in regions that are not coterminous with geologic storage, particularly in the Western and Northern US.}

    abstract = {Supporting the national target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by 2050, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) authorized investments into carbon capture and storage (CCS), highlighting the need for the safe and sustainable transport of carbon dioxide (CO2). Curated to support CO2 pipeline route planning optimization and assess existing energy transport corridors, the CCS Pipeline Route Planning Database is a compilation of 47 publicly available, authoritative geospatial data resources, spanning the contiguous U.S., and some including Alaska and Hawaii. Key considerations were identified following comprehensive literature review, which included state legislation, known pipeline stressors, and energy, environmental, and social justice (EJSJ) considerations. Data layers were sorted into relevant categories (i.e., natural hazards, boundaries) and assigned preliminary weights representing potential social, environmental, and economic costs associated with routing pipelines. Version one of the CCS Pipeline Route Planning Database, made available on the Energy Data eXchange® (EDX), contains categorized vector features representing protected areas, public and energy infrastructure, EJSJ factors, potential risks, federal and state regulations and legislation, and natural features, along with associated metadata. This paper provides details on individual layers, methods used to identify data needs, acquire, and process the disparate data, as well as planned enhancements to future versions of this database.}
